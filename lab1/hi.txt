hi world i love u. "How do you do" is a formal greeting used in the same way as "It's a pleasure to meet you" or "Pleased to meet you." In a casual situation it would be better to say "It's nice to meet you" or just "Hello.""How Do You Do!" is a pop rock song by Swedish pop duo Roxette. It was released as the lead single from their fourth studio album Tourism on 3 July 1992. The track was a commercial success upon release, topping the national singles charts in Norway and Spain. It also peaked at number two in several countries, including Austria, Belgium, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. It was held off the top spot in many of these territories by Dr. Alban's "It's My Life". The single was backed by several remixes created by Swedish production duo BomKrash, which consisted of Jacob Hellner and Carl-Michael Herl√∂fsson.
